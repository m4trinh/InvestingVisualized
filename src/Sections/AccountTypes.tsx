					<li>Any money earned in this account type is not taxed.</li>

							The Canadian government adds more contribution room every year (On

				<ul>
					<li>
						You can only contribute a maximum of ${RESP_CONTRIBUTION_LIMIT} for each
						child.
					</li>
					<li>
						The government will provide a 20% grant on a maximum if $2500 per year. (
						<a href={CESG_INFO_URL}>{CESG_ABBREV}</a>)
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Contributing $2500 annually will get your child $500 annually! (Maximum
							of ${CESG_LIMIT}){' '}
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li>When your child attends post secondary</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The amount you initially put in is returned to you</li>
						<li>
							All investment earnings ({EAP_ABBREV}s) and {CESG_ABBREV} are paid to
							your child (Usually split throughout the duration of post secondary)
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>These payments are taxable</li>
							<li>
								Post Secondary Students usually have none or little income so the tax
								can be offset by tuition credits
							</li>
							<li>
								If you anticipate your child potentially doing an internship at
								Microsoft (or some other company that pays interns large sums of money),
								it may be wise to withdraw the bulk of the RESP early to avoid money
								being taxed in a higher tax bracket
